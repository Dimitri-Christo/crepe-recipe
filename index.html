    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups of whole milk</li>
        <li>1 1/3 cup of flour</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of baking powder</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of sugar</li></ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Sift flour into a large mixing bowl, then add sugar and baking powder. In a separate bowl, combine egg, milk, and vegetable oil.</li>
        <li>Pour wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients and mix well until there's a thin and smooth consistency. Use a power mixer if necessary.</li>
        <li>On medium heat, lightly coat a medium-sized pan with butter. Once pan is heated, pour about 1/3 cup of batter onto the pan until a very thin coating has covered the bottom. A thick layer won't attain the correct results, the first crepe is always the most difficult.</li>
        <li>Check every minute if the bottom has cooked by lifting with a spatula around the edges. Once the edges have a visible "lace", flip the crepe onto the opposite side.</li>
        <li>Once the opposite side is cooked, transfer the crepe to a plate to let cool and repeat these steps until all the batter is used.</li>
        <li>Your repe can be savory or sweet, whichever you're in the modd for! The one above shows mixed berries and confectionary sugar, but other favorites include lemon and sugar, nutella and banana, or mushroom, spinach, and cheese.</li>
